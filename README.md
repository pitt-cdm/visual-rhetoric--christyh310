Hello there! 

Thank you for taking time to look at my visual rhetoric project. The title of this project is “Assimilation is not part of the Puzzle.” I made this project to evoke consideration on your part, particularly consideration for the people and place of the Yakama Nation in Washington. I hope you can see the dignity, distinction, and innate worth of the native people and their culture. I am also arguing that there are many pieces of the puzzle that need to be taken to mend the many years and layers of cultural and physical damage that has been done to native America, but that assimilation isn’t even close to being one of those pieces. 

Where to find the project and extra information:

CDM_puzzle_yakama.xcf – This is the main finalized project, made using GIMP.
