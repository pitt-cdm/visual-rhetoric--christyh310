**Assimilation is not part of the puzzle**

**Argument:**

When I started this project, I wanted to continue to center my projects around a people and place that I care about a lot – the Native Americans on the Yakama Reservation in Washington. The main message that I wanted to get across is a social and cultural commentary, a statement to evoke serious consideration into the assumptions/misunderstandings within the audience, which I took to be any “mainstream” American. Often, it is easy for mainstream America to observe minorities, or other cultures (including Native Americans) and see nothing but the differences and the helplessness of that people group. It can be quite easy to assume that assimilation would resolve many issues, and that resisting this integration into the mainstream culture is ignorant or futile. I am arguing for the dignity, distinction, and innate worth of the native people and their culture. I am also arguing that there are many pieces of the puzzle that need to be taken to mend the many years and layers of cultural and physical damage that has been done to native America, but that assimilation isn’t even close to being one of those pieces. 

**Process of creating my visual rhetoric project:**

I knew that I would want a few (3-5) pictures and a decent amount of negative space in my visual rhetoric project. I also knew that I would want a puzzle-related theme, and so I began learning how to overlay the jigsaw render/pattern onto images. I first thought that using the jigsaw pattern on each individual picture could be helpful, but soon realized that this caused disjointedness within the project, not to mention was difficult technically, and I wasn’t quite skilled enough with GIMP to accomplish this. Also, I realized that even if a layer mask is added to several images at once, those images/pieces can still be made separate by creating new layers within GIMP, and this was incredibly useful to know. So, I arranged photos and then placed the jigsaw pattern over the entire canvas at once, and I began to see the rhythm and movement that I wanted in my piece. This also allowed for comfortable repetition within my project, creating a known puzzle pattern over the images I wanted to display. I’m grateful for this tutorial for helping me out with this layout! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2XWuaUFYEw

I used original pictures that I (or a friend who allowed me to use them) took for my project. I began with three main photos, specifically focused on some of the children that I had met on the Yakama reservation. I juggled the idea of using a wooden background, to help extend the puzzle theme (usually puzzles are put together on a dining room/living room table, and the old wood background helped create this). I also thought the wood could help draw on two parts of life on the reservation: the landscape, and the necessity of firewood for native families. It is used not only for cooking but heat and therefore is quite important.

However, upon thinking more about this background and showing others a preview of my project, I realize that there were too many conflicting patterns, distracting the eye, and not directing attention of the audience to any particular place. So, I removed the background altogether, used a black background, and added more pictures. 

The images I chose to add related to the natural environment around the reservation, or to a playground/after school club: mountains, fields, and sidewalk chalk/multicolored blocks. With the playground related images, I tried to clarify that it is not only the people of the reservation but the restoration of those people’s roles within a community that is vital. Older siblings taking care of younger siblings, or an aunt/grandmother caring for multiple families of children are typical occurrences on a reservation, because many parents are absent, abusive, or struggle with alcohol or other substance abuse. Thus, kids on the reservation have little time to truly be kids and enjoy playing on a playground, for example. So, providing this opportunity (a safe place for kids to be kids) is a way to begin to restore some of the brokenness on the reservation. By implementing these images in my piece, I aimed to bolster my argument in this way.

I tried to adjust the size/scale of each image to take up 3-4 puzzle pieces each, so none of the images was dominant in particular. I adjusted the sizes of the photos to be similar to visually imply that all parts of the ‘puzzle’ (people, place, culture, and even images not in the puzzle yet) are equally important, and that there is not one part of native culture that we shouldn’t at least try to understand, appreciate, and learn about.

In order to draw the viewer’s eye to the words of my visual argument, I used asymmetry, contrast, and proximity. I arranged several puzzle pieces on the top left and bottom right of the page, keeping these pieces close in proximity to one another. Above the words, however, there are fewer pieces, further apart from the rest, and this change in proximity can lift the eyes of the viewer upward. Additionally, by using asymmetry (where the puzzle pieces are heavier on the left and the words are heavier on the top right), I created flow within my piece, drawing the eye to the puzzle pieces around the canvas, and the finally up toward the words. Lastly, I intentionally used contrast between the patterns of the puzzle pieces and the simplicity (white on black) of the words to draw attention to the words and how they contribute to the piece. Within the main statement (“Assimilation is not part of the puzzle”), I made a second statement of a usually subtle/subconscious misunderstanding by highlighting the “I’m not u” in blue. This helps get my point across that just because someone is different from you, or perhaps has different cultural norms, doesn’t mean they aren’t valid, valuable, and worth considering. In fact, there are things we ought to learn from the differences between us. Since blue is a predominant color in several of the images I included, I used blue for these letters to tie the piece together. I used Lucia Sans for the font, because it is used often for posters/could be printed and easily read from far away, and because the simplicity of the font helps with ease of reading among the different patterns of several images in the piece.

**Feedback:** 

I had similar feedback and suggestions from all three people (2 included here) – that I could include another puzzle piece in the bottom left corner.

I decided to not implement this suggestion. First, the negative space I used is intentional – it points to the fact that there are steps we have not yet taken toward native people, that there are gaps in our understanding. Also, just as with an actual puzzle, there is a longing to fill in the missing pieces, to complete the final restored picture – therefore, if the negative space/missing pieces make the audience yearn for the final ‘picture’, or the final goal of reconciliation among mainstream America and native America, then that’s good, that’s actually what I want! If I had created a more completed puzzle, perhaps it would not leave the reader in this tension. 

**Things I learned about GIMP:**

I was able to implement several GIMP tools, including layer mask, flip/rotate, scaling, smudging, erasing, selecting, rendering patterns, and more. The main tool I used to implement the pattern over my images was the filters/render/pattern/jigsaw. To create full puzzle pieces (and not just end the image as a partial piece/rectangle), I was able to copy and blend the image background to extend the image. I used mainly blending, flip/rotate, smudging, and select tools for this.
